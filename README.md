# Space-Invaders

This game has been developed for my Game Development course in third year using C# in Unity3D. The main feature this game offers is represented by the Terminal style menu. Many thanks to my brother **Moot** for composing the music to **KenzeWee* **VulpsVulps** for designing the Artwork.

Hope you'll enjoy it! üôè
