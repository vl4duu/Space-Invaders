# Space-Invaders

This piece of game has been made for my Game Development course in third year using C# in Unity3D. The main feature that this game offers is represented by the Terminal style menu. Many thanks to my brother [Moot](https://soundcloud.com/radu-mutilica) for composing the music to [KenzeWee](https://www.artstation.com/kenze_wee) [VulpsVulps]() for designing the Artwork.

Hope you'll enjoy it! üôè
